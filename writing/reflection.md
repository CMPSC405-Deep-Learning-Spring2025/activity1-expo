### Performance

Did the network's output make sense? - Yes, in our example when our inputs, which in our case was the quality of the weather and tiredness, when those factors were low, we would make it to class. We had to alter some of the weights in order for the output to make sense, but when we did then our results made sense.

How could you adjust weights or activation functions to improve accuracy? - We could alter the weights if we found that our results were not making sense by slightly changing the weights and adjusting them to make the results make more sense. We could do this by slightly decreasing, or increasing them in order to provide better outcomes.

What did you notice about how small changes (e.g., weights) affect outcomes? - These kinds of changes were able to affect the outcomes because in our function this was the number that we would multiply by in order to compare the result to the final number to determine if we would make it to class or not based on our inputs.

### Ethics

What potential biases or ethical considerations could arise in your example scenario? - Potential biases that may come up in our example if a student may have more drive to be a better student and will let our inputs not bother them as much and they will attend class anyways. Also on the other hand if the tolerance and bias is very high then the student may not attend class even when they are not tired at all and the weather is really good.

### Reflection

What was easy to understand about the neural network? - Seeing the in class example made neural networks easy to understand seeing a simplified example in order to understands how each of the parts of the network work, and how they depend on each part in order to produce a meaningful result.

What challenges did they face? - Some challenges we faced as I mentioned above was making small changed to our weights in order to make sure that our results that were produced made sense along with our inputs and topic. Once we found out how to balance the weights of the inputs it made it a lot easier.
